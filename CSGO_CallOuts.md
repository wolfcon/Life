### Detail

| Callout Name    | Callout Description                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A Short         | The walkway that connects mid to the A bombsite. It's typically used by Ts to rush on eco/pistol rounds, or to split A with another group of Ts pincering the site from A Long. |
| T Spawn         | The side of the map where the Terrorist side spawns. A small section of T spawn offers a view down mid to mid doors, giving Ts the chance to see which CTs cross over to B. |
| T Ramp          | This is the ramp that leads down from T Spawn to outside B Tunnels. The term genuinly refers to the ramp section only, rather than the raised platform, which is called T Platform. |
| T Plat          | This is the raised platform that leads from T Spawn to outside B Tunnels. It features several stacks of bricks that can be used to watch B Tunnels from a strong position. T Plat borders T Ramp. |
| Outside Tunnels | The area just outside of B Tunnels when approaching them from T Spawn. This is quite a broad, open area, so this callout covers quite a bit of space. |
| Upper B Tunnels | This is one of two sections of B Tunnels. It begins at the entrance to B Tunnels from T Spawn, and extends to the chokepoint that leads to the B bombsite. |
| Lower B Tunnels | This is one of two sections of B Tunnels. It begins at the stairs leading down from Upper Tunnels into the corridor that connects the Tunnels to mid, and ends at the archway into mid. |
| Close           | A loose callout, but this is generally what the left corner as you exit B Tunnels onto the B site as a Terrorist is referred to. It's a very close angle that, if left unchecked by the Terrorists, can be very deadly. |
| B Closet        | This is the corner of B Site where the car is located, to the right of Tunnels as you exit them or to the left of B doors. |
| B Car           | This is the car on B site to the right of Tunnels Exit and to the left of B doors if you enter from mid. This callout is only used if there's a player directly behind the car - if they're in the corner next to car then that is typically called Closet instead. |
| Fence           | This is the fenced off wall on B Site that can provide a hiding spot invisible to the Ts until they have moved from Tunnels onto B site. |
| B Plat          | This is the elevated area of the B bombsite next to where the bomb can be planted, and is directly opposite the exit of B Tunnels. |
| Back Plat       | This is the backend of B Plat. It has a seperate callout name as when you're on the bombsite you won't be able to see the back of B Plat, so this is used when a player is tucked right into the edge of the area. |
| Big Box         | This is the big box that resembles the Xbox in mid, that sits on B site. It is between B Plat and the bombsite. |
| Double Stack    | This callout refers to the two boxes that are stacked on top of each other in the middle of the B bombsite. These are not to be confused with the boxes that lead to B Window. |
| B Default Plant | Where the bomb is most commonly planted on the B Site. It hugs the brick wall, is just below B Window, and on the side of B Doors. |
| B Window        | This is the hole in the brick wall on the B site, that has several boxes serving as a platform to reach it as its raised off the ground. It's a common position to use when defending the B bombiste and retaking it. |
| B Back Site     | This is the back of the B bombsite, as if you were looking at it from the Tunnels Exit. It typically refers to the area behind all of the boxes on B, and borders with B Plat. |

| B Boxes         | This callout refers to the boxes between CT Mid and B Doors. They are often used as a vantage point to watch players attempting to come from mid to B. |

| Xbox            | The box in Mid, by the doors, that can be used to gain access onto Catwalk and A Short. It is opposite the exit from Lower B Tunnels. |
| Mid             | The middle area of the map, that extends from Mid Doors to the top of Mid. Generally the area of Mid that slopes is what will be called as "Mid". |
| Palm            | The now-telephone mast that sits near the top of mid next to Catwalk, where there was once a Palm Tree. |
| Right Side Mid  | The indented area of Mid that is on the right if you're looking from Mid Doors up towards T spawn. It has this callout as typically only CTs will be calling it, so therefore it is correct for their viewpoint. |
| Top Mid         | The top of Mid if you're looking from Mid Doors up towards T Spawn. This connects Suicide with Mid. |
| Suicide         | The pit that is used to jump down from T Spawn and run straight to Top Mid. It is directly opposite Mid Doors, and earned its name from being perilous at times to jump into due to potential AWPers. |
| Outside Long    | This is the open space outside of Long Doors on the T Spawn side of the map. It connects T Spawn to Long Doors and A Long. |
| Long Doors      | This area defines the two sets of Double Doors that lead from Outside Long to A Long. |
| Blue            | This is the large, blue shipping crate that stands opposite A Long Doors. |
| Side Pit        | This is the area of ground that is between Pit and A Long Doors. The differentiation between this area and Pit is when the ground starts to slope downwards, and the small brick wall before the Pit area. |
| Pit             | The sloped-down area that is outside of Long Doors and at the end of A Long. It faces opposite to the A Site but is a decline, so players can be in Pit but hidden from A Site. |
| Pit Plat        | The platform to the right of Pit if you're looking at it from the bottom of pit. It allows for some good sniping angles onto the A site. |
| A Long          | This is the space of ground that connects Long Doors and Pit to the A Bombsite. It is a long narrow stretch of ground. |
| Long Corner     | The corner of the closest building to Long Doors. It is a very common place for CTs to hold against pushes at A Long. |
| A Car           | The car that is tucked away to the right side of A Long if you're approaching from Pit. It can be used to watch A Short or A Long, and this call covers the general area around the car. |
| A Cross         | This is the open area that seperates A Long from A Site. It is wildly exposed to every angle - Site, CT Spawn, Short - which is why it's called "Cross." |
| A Ramp          | The ramp that leads upwards from A Cross to the A Bombsite.  |
| A Default Plant | The default plant spot on A. It is on the edge of the raised platform, as close to A Long as possible to provide the best visibiltiy from every angle to attack any CTs defusing. |
| Barrels         | The set of barrels that sit behind A Site, near the mesh fencing. |
| Goose           | The enclosed section behind A Site and Barrels that has the image of a goose spraypainted onto it. |
| Elevator        | One of the corners of the A Site Platform, closest to the side of CT Spawn. It earned its callout as it's a common position for CTs to boost teammates up onto the bombsite when retaking. |
| Short Boost     | The set of dumpsters right outside of CT Spawn on the A side. These can be used to boost CTs onto A Short faster than running there gets them. |
| A Platform      | The platform that the A bombsite is placed on. This is quick a broad callout, but generally refers to the area between the A Bombsite itself and A Short. |
| A Ninja         | A hidey-hole behind a stack of boxes on the A Short side of A that can be used to Ninja defuse by the CTs if the Ts all come from A Long and don't clear the position. |
| Stairs          | The set of stairs that connect Catwalk with A Short.         |
| Catwalk         | The walkway on the side of Mid that leads onto A Short and the A Bombsite. Generally this callout is defined by the start of the Catwalk at the top of Mid up until Short Stairs, where it transitions into A Short. |
